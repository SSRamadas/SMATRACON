# SMATRACON
SMART TRAFFIC CONTROL Using Image Processing


PROJECT IDEA:

Now-a-days traffic management has become one of the most severe problems in the world due to the growth of industrialization and population. Due to the tremendous growth in the traffic, control of traffic by humans became difficult and so machine powered traffic controllers were developed using the modern technologies. As a result, control over the traffic became some-what reduced. Due to the heavy population in the cities as well as villages traffic problems like heavy traffic jams, violation of traffic rules, improper traffic management and traffic congestion increased enormously that results in long waiting times, loss of life, wastage of fuel and money, accidents,etc., 

To solve the problem, a fast, economical and efficient traffic control system for national development and public sustenance is needed. Among all the best ways of improving traffic flow and safety of the current transportation system, practical application of automation and intelligent control methods to roadside infrastructure as well as vehicles is the best and quick method.

AIM:

To moderate and examine the traffic in efficient and smart way we exploit the new and easy technique called as “SMATRACON – SMART TRAFFIC CONTROL using Image Processing”.In the busy traffic we can easily identify the ambulance image by the sensors attached with the cameras along with the embedded technology and then undergo the process with the images of the ambulance provided and then match them in the server so that location of ambulance thereby moderating of traffic can be done.


FUNCTIONALITIES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT:

1) To develop the system which can be efficient using artifical intelligence, such that the concept image processing technique is implemented in such a way that the estimation of actual road traffic in the particular area is determined by counting the number of vehicles in the traffic upto the particular distance and identify the emergency vehicle like ambulance location.

2) To monitor the system in such a way that the count of vehicles is displayed in digital way and matching the images of ambulance is matched to the image captured at that location easily within few minutes.

3) Developing the server to handle previous data in automatic way.
